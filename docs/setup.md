# Setup

## 1. Install node.js and npm

For Mac and Windows, get the installer from [nodejs.org][node-download]
and install it. That will get you `node` and `npm`.

For Linux distributions, check [this article][install-linux] on how to install
a current version of node.js. (Note: the article is also linked from
[node's wiki page][node-wiki-install].)

## 2. Setup git and GitHub

See [Setting up Git][git-setup]
on GitHub's website for instructions to get started with git and GitHub.


## 3. Join gitter channel

We're hanging out on [gitter.im][gitter-monogodb-js], join the channel to stay
up to date or ask questions.
